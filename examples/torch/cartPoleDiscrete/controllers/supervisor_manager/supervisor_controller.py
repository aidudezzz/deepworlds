class CartPoleSupervisor(SupervisorCSV):
    """
    CartPoleSupervisor acts as an environment having all the appropriate methods such as get_reward().

    Taken from https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py and modified for Webots.
    Description:
        A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves forwards and backwards. The pendulum
        starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over by increasing and reducing the cart's
        velocity.
    Source:
        This environment corresponds to the version of the cart-pole problem described
        by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson
    Observation:
        Type: Box(4)
        Num	Observation                 Min         Max
        0	Cart Position z axis      -0.4            0.4
        1	Cart Velocity             -Inf            Inf
        2	Pole Angle                -1.3 rad        1.3 rad
        3	Pole Velocity At Tip      -Inf            Inf

    Actions:
        Type: Discrete(2)
        Num	Action
        0	Move cart forward
        1	Move cart backward

        Note: The amount the velocity that is reduced or increased is not fixed; it depends on the angle the pole is
        pointing. This is because the center of gravity of the pole increases the amount of energy needed to move the
        cart underneath it
    Reward:
        Reward is 1 for every step taken, including the termination step
    Starting State:
        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    Episode Termination:
        Pole Angle is more than 0.261799388 rad (15 degrees)
        Cart Position is more than 0.39 on z axis (cart has reached arena edge)
        Episode length is greater than 200
        Solved Requirements (average episode score in last 100 episodes > 195.0)
