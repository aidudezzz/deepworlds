    This example is taken from Webots https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/pit_escape/ example.

    Program a BB-8 robot lost in a sand desert to climb out of a pit as quickly as possible.
    This benchmark aims at developing a program that controls a BB-8 robot to escape from a pit.

    Metrics:
    The robot has to get out of the pit as fast as possible. The benchmark stops if the robot takes more than one
    minute to escape. If the robot is able to get out of the pit, the metric will be based on how fast the robot was
    to get out. Otherwise, the metric will measure how close it was from escaping. In the first case the metric ranges
    from 50% to 100% and is linearly correlated with the time result. A value of 100% is awarded for an instantaneous
    escape, while a value of 50% is awarded for a last-second escape. In the second case the metric ranges from 0% to
    50% and is linearly correlated with the distance from the top of the pit.

    How to improve the performance?
    The slope is too steep for the robot to simply go forward. Instead, it should go back and forth to accumulate
    momentum until it has enough to climb out of the pit.

    Observation:
    Num	Observation                   Min         Max
    0	BB-8 Gyro X axis            -Inf            Inf
    1	BB-8 Gyro Y axis            -Inf            Inf
    2	BB-8 Gyro Z axis            -Inf            Inf
    3	BB-8 Accelerometer X axis   -Inf            Inf
    4	BB-8 Accelerometer Y axis   -Inf            Inf
    5	BB-8 Accelerometer Z axis   -Inf            Inf

    Actions:
        Type: Discrete(4)
        Num Action
        0   Set pitch motor speed to maxSpeed
        1   Set pitch motor speed to -maxSpeed
        2   Set yaw motor speed to maxSpeed
        3   Set yaw motor speed to -maxSpeed

        Note: maxSpeed is set in the robot controller.
    Reward:
        Reward method implementation works based on https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/pit_escape/ metric.
        The metric is based on the robot's distance from the pit center. It gets updated when the maximum
        distance from pit center achieved increases. If the robot escapes the pit, the metric is set to 0.5 plus
        a term based on episode time elapsed.

        Thus, the metric monotonically increases and moves from 0.0 to 1.0 on instantaneous escape. Unsolved
        episode's metric varies between 0.0 and 0.5 and solved episode's metric varies between 0.5 and 1.0.

        The step reward return is the difference between the previous step's metric and the current metric. Due to
        the fact that the metric increases monotonically, the difference returned is always >= 0, and > 0 at a step
        where a higher distance from center is achieved.
    Starting State:
        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    Episode Termination:
        Episode ends after 60.0 seconds or if the robot escapes from the pit, which is calculated based on its
        distance from the pit center and the pit radius.
