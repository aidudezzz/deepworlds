# Pit Escape

This example is the [Pit Escape](https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/pit_escape/) problem included in 
[Webots](https://cyberbotics.com). This problem is an extended 
[MountainCar](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/) problem, in 3 dimensions and more complicated 
observation and action spaces.

One solution of the problem is provided, using a discrete action space.
It is solved with the 
[Proximal Policy Optimization Reinforcement (PPO) Learning (RL) algorithm](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/).
It uses [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as the backend neural network library.

More Pit Escape examples can be added in the future, using other algorithms/backends and a continuous action space.
