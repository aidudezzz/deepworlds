# Franka Emika Panda with Deepbots and Reinforcement Learning
> [deepbots](https://github.com/aidudezzz/deepbots)\
> [Franka Emika Panda](https://www.franka.de/technology)

The Panda robot model was made from [these files](https://github.com/mkrizmancic/franka_gazebo/tree/master/meshes).\
We are trying to solve some interesting problems with reinforcement learning and finally deploy the models in the real world.

## Installation
1. [Install Webots R2021a](https://www.cyberbotics.com/)
2. Install Python versions 3.8
    * Follow the Using Python guide provided by Webots
3. Install deepbots 0.1.3.dev2 through pip running the following command:\
<code>pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ deepbots</code>
4. Install PyTorch via pip

## Goal reaching with a 7-DoF Panda robotic arm
The goal is to train an agent to reach the randomly selected goal within limited steps.\
Here, the problem is solved with the [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient RL algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971). The agent observes its seven motor positions and the Cartesian coordinates of the selected goal, and then controls the seven motor positions.
